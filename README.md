# Learning Julia

## The goal
The goal of this repository is to learn Julia syntax and getting familiar with it.

*Disclaimer: As this repository holds many little projects to learn how to work with Julia and get familiar with its syntax, the coding style might not be as clean yet, the projects will often be unrelated to each other and possibly look like a work in progress.*
